2. Download camera_calibration_points csv file. Click "raw" and save as csv (https://github.com/DerekGloudemans/I24-video-processing/blob/main/config/camera_calibration_points_I24_validation_system.csv)
and add to your local repository such that the directory looks like

As for the roadmap, for the short term we can:
1. Recreate the same plots that I showed you today by playing around this notebook. You’re welcome to add your own modifications to it.
2. Overlay a road drawing at the background (so that we know which lane the cars are at)
3. Make an animation!
4. Add multiple vehicles across different camera view.
